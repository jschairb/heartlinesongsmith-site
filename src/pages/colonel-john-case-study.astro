					title='Case Study: "Colonel John and the Giants"'
					subtitle="A song of endurance, legacy, and quiet heroism."
				>
					<p>"Colonel John and the Giants" began as a personal commission — a song written to honor my college professor, a Vietnam War search-and-rescue pilot whose stories quietly shaped the way I saw courage, teaching, and time.</p>
					
					<p>The track became the emotional and thematic anchor of the album: a mythic transformation of a real man into legend. Through rambling, widescreen storytelling, it chronicles Colonel John's hundred missions over the jungle canopy, flying three green helicopters — the "Giants" — through tracer fire and impossible odds to carry the living home.</p>
					
					<p>But the song isn't just about war. It's about continuity: how the endurance that saves lives in one era can reappear decades later in the patience of a teacher, the steadiness of a mentor, the simple act of showing up.</p>

					<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-amber-800 dark:text-amber-300 pt-4 !mb-2 font-serif">The Musical Approach</h3>
					<p>Musically, the piece blends '70s Americana storytelling with cinematic desert rock textures — pedal-steel slides over deep toms, a slow 6/8 sway that mirrors the rhythm of helicopter blades. The arrangement moves between two timeframes:</p>
					<ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-5 space-y-2">
						<li>The chaos of combat, where Colonel John's calm voice cuts through rotor noise and gravity's pull.</li>
						<li>The quiet authority of a classroom, where chalk dust settles like afterburn and hard-won wisdom passes down like embers.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The refrain — "Take life as it comes" — became both lyric and mantra, bridging those worlds. In the end, Colonel John stands as both historical figure and spiritual guide. His West Texas sky becomes a metaphor for vast endurance — the open horizon you keep flying toward when the world demands your courage.</p>
