		title: "How fast is the \"SPEED+\" last-minute delivery?",
		description: "It's genuinely fast! Our \"SPEED+\" service is designed for those gifting emergencies. Once you submit your story through our intake form, our artists get to work immediately. You can expect to receive your finished, high-quality MP3 song in a matter of hours, typically within 24 hours of your submission. It's the most personal, thoughtful gift you can get at the last minute.",
	},
	{
		title: "What kind of information do I need to provide for my song?",
		description: `The more details, the better, but you don't need to write a novel! Our intake form will guide you, but think about things like:
					<ul style="list-style: inside;">
						<li>The occasion (anniversary, birthday, etc.)</li>
						<li>Key names, places, or dates.</li>
						<li>A few cherished memories or funny inside jokes.</li>
						<li>The overall feeling you're going for (sweet, funny, nostalgic).</li>
						<li>A few artists or genres you both love (e.g., "something that feels like a 90s country song," or "a simple acoustic vibe like Ed Sheeran").</li>
					</ul>`,
	},
	{
		title: "Will I get to approve the lyrics before the song is finished?",
		description: `That depends on the service you choose!<br/><br/>
					<strong>Standard Service:</strong> Yes! This is our collaborative option. We'll send you a "Track Vision" with draft lyrics for the main sections for you to approve before we record the final song.<br/><br/>
					<strong>SPEED+ Service:</strong> To ensure lightning-fast delivery, we bypass the collaborative feedback step. Our talented artists will take your story and run with it, using their expertise to craft the perfect song in one go.`,
	},
	{
		title: "What will my song sound like? Can I pick the genre?",
		description: "You have a lot of input on the sound! In the intake form, you can specify genres, moods, and even reference specific artists you like. Whether you want a simple acoustic ballad, an upbeat pop-rock anthem, or a country story-song, our musicians will tailor the track to fit the vibe you're looking for.",
	},
	{
		title: "What do I get with my final order?",
		description: "Your final delivery includes a professionally mixed and mastered song (approximately 2-3 minutes long) as a high-quality digital download (MP3 and WAV formats). You'll also receive a digital booklet containing the final lyrics, perfect for printing out. Physical formats like CDs and cassettes are available as add-ons but require additional production and shipping time.",
	},
	{
		title: "What if I want to change something after the song is done?",
		description: "Because each song is a completely custom piece of art, we don't offer revisions on the final delivered track. This is why the \"Track Vision\" approval step is so important in our Standard Service. For SPEED+ orders, trust our artists to capture the essence of your story beautifully on the first take!",
	},
	{
		title: "Can I share my song online or play it at an event?",
		description: "Absolutely! It's your song. You have full rights to share it on social media, play it at your wedding, anniversary party, or any other private event. If you're interested in a wider, public release, ask us about our add-on to get your song on streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music!",
